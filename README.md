[Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org) (or HUD, for short) is a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://humanityunchained.org) whose goal is for human civilization to transition from the currently imposed modern state system which enslaves humanity through cohertion, which is the root of corruption, poverty, war, and many other calamities, to a society based on the individuals' voluntary pledge to organizational structures (also known as social contracts). We called the new scoiety the New Free World (NFW).

HUD uses a [decentralized app](TODO) that implements an [self-sovereign](TODO) [sybil-resistant](TODO) identity registry and a [semi-direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-direct_democracy) on the [blockchain](TODO). Members of HUD voluntarily register their identity in the app and swear to pledge by the [HUD constitution](./CONSTITUTION). The Constitution establishes a set of universal and irremovable rules for a just and peaceful coexistence among all human beings regardless of their ideologies, location, wealth or otherwise. The main rule in the Constitution is the prohibition of cohertion or violence on any human being unless specified within the terms on a contract previously agreed by the human being. This is the key for transitioning to the NFW. The members of the DAO can democratically decide on any additional rules or actions subordinated to the Constitution. The DAO can also act as a jury by prosecuting a member according the DAO's rules. This is incentiviced through reputational and economic means.

The app allows anyone to create new organizations through the issuance of a special type of token called *emblem* and its distribution to the organization's members. Holding an emblem represents a binding contract between the emblem creator and the holder. This contract can be enforced by the DAO in case of dispute. Emblems can be circumscribed geographically on a world map in the app. We call these emblems *regions*. A region's contract can define any rules that their holders have to abide. There are no restrictions for such rules, which can define many aspects of the society and the economy in the region, as far as these rules are within the Constitutional framework. For example, public services and the protection of individual rights, and their funding through fees, can be defined by such rules. Regions can share territories. HUD members are able to create and frictionlessly move to the societies they want to live in, creating a free market of regions that compete with each other for members.
